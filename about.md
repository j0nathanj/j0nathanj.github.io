# Background üñºÔ∏è  
  
* My journey with computers began when I started playing MapleStory in elementary school, and it quickly led me to explore game hacking and programming.

* During high school I worked at [Check Point](https://www.checkpoint.com/) as a Vulnerability Researcher for almost a year. 
  
* At 17 years old, I joined [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc) as a Vulnerability Researcher on the MSRC-IL team.
    * Fun fact: At just 17, I held the title of the *Youngest Microsoft Employee in the world*.

* Co-Founder of the hacking team [Perfect Blue](https://perfect.blue/).
  * Ranked as the **#1 CTF team in the world** for 3 years (2020‚Äì2021, 2023) and consistently in the **top 10** for the past 6 years.
  * We are an international CTF team founded by a few teenagers from different countries around the world üåç.
  * Participated in world-renouned CTF events like DEFCON CTF, Google CTF, Real World CTF, and many more.
  
* I also ocassionally play CTFs with [Pasten](https://twitter.com/pastenctf?lang=en).

  * **Research:** worked on some of the unit's most cutting-edge research projects.
  * **Commanded** the IDF's most elite cybersecurity course.
  * **Deputy Head of Research Section:** responsible for the ideation, management and leadership of revolutionary research projects.

* I joined the CTO Office at [Dazz](dazz.io), focusing on product growth by understanding market demands and customer pain points to shape the product's future and maximize its value.
